# Relatives
We Chinese people have such a long history and complicated culture and tradition. Even deciding how to call your relatives could be a difficult task! So I wrote this small tool to help decide what to call the relatives. 
As people from different parts of China have slightly different cultures, this tool serves those from Northeastern China best.
